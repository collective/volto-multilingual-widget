# volto-multilingual-widget

A widget for [Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) to insert values for any language enabled

To be used with mrs-developer, see [Volto docs](https://docs.voltocms.com/customizing/add-ons/) for further usage informations.

## Usage

This is meant to be used on JSON or text fields, because it will send to the registry a string with a JSON inside.

In your Volto project, in `src/config.js` you can bind this widget for an id, example:

```js
import {Â MultilingualWidget } from 'volto-multilingual-widget'

...

export const widgets = {
  ...defaultWidgets,
  id: {
    ...defaultWidgets.id,
    cookie_consent_configuration: MultilingualWidget(),
  },
}
```

### Custom widget

If you see, you're not using the component directly, but you call as a function.
The default widget used for the form is a rich text editor, which saves strings with html.
As a parameter, you can pass a custom widget for language specific values, like:

```jsx
import { MultilingualWidget } from 'volto-multilingual-widget'

...

const CustomWidget = ({ id, value, placeholder, onChange }) => (
  <input type="number" id={id} placeholder={placeholder} value={value} onChange={onChange} />
)

export const widgets = {
  ...defaultWidgets,
  id: {
    ...defaultWidgets.id,
    cookie_consent_configuration: MultilingualWidget(CustomWidget),
  },
}
```

Multilingual widget is agnostic about value types and handles the multilingual aspect more than data specific ones.
So you could handle boolean or numeric values, which will be saved in a JSON as described below.

The only contrain about custom widget is based on the props, which are:

**id** _(string)_
ID attribute of the widget element, bound to the label for accessibility reasons.

**value** _(any)_
Language specific value.

**placeholder** _(string)_
Placeholder text of the input

**onChange** _(function)_
This is the method that will apply updates to the final JSON.
Its firm is:

`langValue => void`

and you should pass directly the language specific value, so the type of the parameter should be the same as `value` one.

## Results

What will be sent to Plone is in this format, with a key for any enabled language in your Plone site:

```json
{
  "it": "<p>Il tuo testo in italiano</p>",
  "en": "<p>Your text in English</p>",
  "eo": "<p>Via esperanta teksto</p>"
}
```
